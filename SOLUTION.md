<!-- You can include documentation, additional setup instructions, notes etc. here -->

1- I added the lodash library, It contains a lot of js fonctionalities (foreach, map, include ...) that we can use with many data types (array, strings, ..)

2- To fetch the user data I used the fetch api 

3- I added a services.js class, you find within all methods I used to collect data

4- I fixed a rule to autocomplete.js : data must be in format { text, value}.
